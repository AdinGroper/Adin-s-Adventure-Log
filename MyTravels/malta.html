        <div class="dest-intro">
            <p> Malta is a country located in the Mediterranean Sea, just south of Italy. The Maltese archipelago consists of a group of islands,
                with Malta serving as the largest. It is joined by the islands of Comino and Gozo to the north, which are accessible by ferry or
                boat.

            <h3>June 2024</h3>
            <p> Following a great deal on a Ryanair flight, my friend Shaofeng and I made our way to Malta for a quick weekend trip. We arrived
                shortly after midnight and made way to our Airbnb in Sliema, a small town located on Malta's northeastern coast.
            </p>
            <p> After a late start the next morning, we took a bus all the way to the northern-most part of the island to catch a small ferry boat
                to Comino. The boat driver took us through some rock formations beneath the island before eventually dropping us off at the Blue
                Lagoon, the main attraction of Comino. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dest-combo">
            <img src="/Media/Malta/comino-pineapple.jpg">
            <p> Shaofeng immediately ordered the famous Blue Lagoon pineapple cocktail, a drink sold at stands everywhere around the lagoon. It is 
                made from a pineapple with its top chopped off, then filled with pineapple juice and any alcohol of your choosing (though Shaofeng 
                opted for the nonalcoholic version to keep his head in the game for our very busy day to come). I wasn't a fan of the drink, but
                I couldn't help myself in grabbing a sick photo with it in front of the turquoise backdrop of the lagoon.
            </p>
            <img src="/Media/Malta/comino-viewpoint.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="dest-text">
            <p> We then explored off the beaten path a bit more of Comino, stopping at a vantage point for some photos, before heading back down
                to the lagoon to dip our toes in the water. From what I could tell, the island was mostly barren, covered only in rocks and small
                shrubs. I was honestly quite surprised to find not a single tree nearby to provide some much needed shade from the sun, especially
                given that there were no clouds in sight either. Down by the water, it felt like spring break in Miami with beach-goers a plenty! 
                While the sight of the water was beautiful, I'd say it was a bit too hectic for me to consider the Blue Lagoon a relaxing vacation 
                spot. In total we spent about an hour and a half on Comino before catching the next boat north to the island of Gozo.

        <div class="dest-combo">
            <p> In Gozo we ate a quick lunch and made our way to Victoria, the island's largest town located at its center. From there, we walked
                to the Citadella de Victoria, a historic castle that dates back to medieval times. We explored the narrow streets within, stopping 
                to grab a photo in front of the Cathedral of the Assumption, then took a lap around the castle ramparts with a 360 degree views 
                over the rest of the island.

        <div class="dest-text">
            <p> For the rest of the day, Uber and Bolt became our friends. Without a car or motorbike, it would have been impossible to traverse
                the entire island. Our next point of interest was the Tal-Mixta Cave, a small and remote cavern that opened cliffside to the beach
                and bay below. There was an insanely strong blast of wind at the cave's entrance followed by complete stillness inside the cavern, 
                which reminded me of a reservoir leading to a converging-diverging nozzle (a concept from my compressible flow course).  
            </p>

        <div class="dest-combo">
            <img src="/Media/Malta/gozo-saltpans.jpg">
            <p> From there, we took a quick Bolt ride along the coast to the Xwejni Salt Pans. The salt pans are made up of thousands of sqaure
                holes dug into the ground along the coastline, that accumulate natural sea salt over time as ocean water fills the holes and
                evaporates. In other words, it's a way of naturally harvesting salt from the environment. Shaofeng and I walked along the salt pan
                filled coastline, stopping occasionally along the way to admire the strength of the waves crashing against the cliffside or to
                poke fun at the "NO BBQ" signs posted around. 
            </p>

        <div class="dest-text">
            <p> It was just the two of us out there, with limestone walls to our left and the vast ocean to our right. If I didn't know any
                any better, I would say it felt like we were alone on an entirely different planet - quite a surreal experience. We walked west
                until reaching the Wied il-Ghasri, a long gorge with a river flowing inland from the sea.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dest-combo">
            <img src="/Media/Malta/gozo-window.jpg">
            <p> Our next stop was at the Wied il-Mielah Window, a rock formation on the coastline that resembled a giant window out to sea. At
                first we couldn't find it, until we realized we were standing on top of it the whole time! There wasn't much else in the area, so
                our stay there was brief before we headed out to our final destination of the day: the Blue Hole viewpoint. It was at the western
                side of the island - perfect for watching the sunset. The famous Azure Window, a large arch there which once stood as gateway to
                the sea, unfortunately fell in 2017 (so we didn't get to see it for obvious reasons). I captured a nice timelapse of the sunset
                before Shaofeng and I were attacked by a swarm of mosquitos, ran for our lives, and finally caught an Uber back to the ferry
                station and a ferry back to the Airbnb on Malta.

            <p> Day 2 of the trip, we stuck around the main island all day until our evening return flight. We started the day exploring a bit of
                Sliema and later Valletta, the capital city of Malta. Walking through Valletta felt like a trip to the past. With most of the city
                made from limestone bricks, we definitely got an old town feel. The city skyline is best distinguished by the large dome atop the
                Basilica of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which was best seen from across the harbor.

        </div>
        <div class="dest-text">
            <p> Also located in Valletta were the Upper and Lower Barrakka gardens. Each offered a small area of greenery and a nice view out over
                the Grand Harbour. Across the harbor we could see the Three Cities, composing of fortified cities built on peninsulas. This part of
                Malta became a popular filming location for many production crews over the years.

        <div class="dest-text">
            <p> In the afternoon, we took an Uber to Mdina in the center of the island. Mdina was another fortified city dating back to medieval
                times. We explored the city briefly, walking through narrow alleyways and admiring some of the intricate facades found within.
                The most notable part was the bridge and main gate leading into city, which was featured as King's Landing in Game of Thrones.

            <p> We ended the day at the southern coast of the island, getting a glimpse from above at the Blue Grotto - a collection of rock
                formations and sea caves in the water below. We noticed small boat tours darting in and out of the caves, so on a whim, we decided
                to look for more info closer to the water. To our surprise, we managed to buy tickets and hop on a boat last minute. The tour went
                by quickly, but we got to see a bunch of cool rock formations and beautiful blue water in the caves under the island.

        <div class="dest-text">
            <p> Afterwards, we made our way back to the airport and bid the Maltese archipelago a farewell. I managed to capture a few photos
                from the plane, which really put into perspective how small Malta is when surrounded by the rest of the Mediterranean Sea.

        <div class="dest-text">
            <p> Overall, I'd say Malta makes for a unique destination. The variety of rock formations along the coastines were fascinating to see,
                and the weather, despite being so hot, was a welcome feeling of warmth. But I will say, I was not expecting the climate to feel so
                arid and desert-like; I thought the island would be a bit more tropical like the beaches I'm used to seeing in south Florida. With
                only a day and a half in Malta, I'll definitely need to come back and see more of what the island has to offer.
