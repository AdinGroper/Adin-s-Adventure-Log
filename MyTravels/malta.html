        <div class="dest-intro">
            <p>Malta is a country located in the Mediterranean Sea, just south of Italy. The Maltese archipelago consists of a group of islands,
                with Malta serving as the largest. It is joined by the islands of Comino and Gozo to the north, which are accessible by ferry or
                boat.

            <h3>June 2024</h3>
            <p> Following a great deal on a Ryanair flight, Shaofeng and I made our way to Malta for a quick weekend trip. We arrived shortly after
                midnight and made way to our AirBnB in Sliema, a small town located on Malta's northeastern coast.
            </p>
            <p> After a late start the next morning, we took a bus all the way to the northern-most part of the island to catch a small ferry boat
                to Comino. The boat driver took us through the rock formations beneath the island before eventually dropping us off at the Blue
                Lagoon, the main attraction of Comino. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="dest-photo">

        <div class="dest-combo">
            <img src="/Media/Malta/comino-pineapple.jpg">
            <p> Shaofeng immediately ordered the famous Blue Lagoon pineapple cocktail, a drink sold at stands everywhere around the lagoon. It is 
                made from a pineapple with its top chopped off, then filled with pineapple juice and any alcohol of your choosing (though Shaofeng 
                opted for the nonalcoholic version to keep his head in the game for our very busy day to come). I wasn't a fan of the drink, but
                I couldn't help myself in grabbing a sick photo with it in front of the turquoise backdrop of the lagoon.
            </p>
            <img src="/Media/Malta/comino-viewpoint.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="dest-text">
            <p> We then explored off the beaten path a bit more of Comino, stopping at a vantage point for some photos, before heading back down to
                the lagoon to dip our toes in the water. From what I could tell, the island was mostly barren, covered only in rocks and small
                shrubs. I was honestly quite surprised to find not a single tree nearby to provide some much needed shade from the sun, especially
                given that there were no clouds in sight either. Down by the water, it felt like spring break in Miami with beach-goers a plenty! 
                While the sight of the water was beautiful, I'd say it was a bit too hectic for me to consider the Blue Lagoon a relaxing vacation 
                spot. In total we spent about an hour and a half on Comino before catching the next boat north to the island of Gozo.
            </p>
            <p> In Gozo we ate a quick lunch and made our way to Victoria, the island's largest town located at its center. From there, we walked to
                the Citadella de Victoria, a historic castle that dates back to medieval times. We explored the narrow streets within, stopping to 
                grab a photo in front of the Cathedral of the Assumption, then took a lap around the castle ramparts with a 360 degree views over 
                the rest of the island.
            </p>
            <p> For the rest of the day, Uber and Bolt became our friends. Without a car or motorbike, it would have been impossible to traverse
                the entire island. Our next point of interest was the Tal-Mixta Cave, a small and remote cavern that opened cliffside to the beach
                and bay below. There was an insanely strong blast of wind at the cave's entrance followed by complete stillness inside the cavern, 
                which reminded me of a reservoir leading to a converging-diverging nozzle (a concept from my compressible flow course).  
            </p>
            <P> From there, we took a quick Bolt ride along the coast to the Xwejni Salt Pans. The salt pans are made up of thousands of sqaure
                holes dug into the ground along the coastline, that accumulate natural sea salt over time as ocean water fills the holes and
                evaporates. In other words, it's a way of naturally harvesting salt from the environment. Shaofeng and I walked along the salt pan
                filled coastline, stopping occasionally along the way to admire the strength of the waves crashing against the cliffside or to
                poke fun at the "NO BBQ" signs posted around. It was just the two of us out there, with limestone walls to our left and the vast
                ocean to our right. If I didn't know any better, I would say it felt like we were alone on an entirely different planet - quite a
                surreal experience. We walked west until reaching the Wied il-Ghasri, a long gorge with a river flowing inland from the sea.
            </P>
            <P> Our next stop was at the Wied il-Mielah Window, a rock formation on the coastline that resembled a giant window out to sea. At
                first we couldn't find it, until we realized we were standing on top of it the whole time! There wasn't much else in the area, so
                our stay there was brief before we headed out to our final destination of the day: the Blue Hole viewpoint. It was at the western
                side of the island - perfect for watching the sunset. The famous Azure Window, which once stood there as a large gateway to the
                sea, unfortunately fell in 2017 (so we didn't get to see it for obvious reasons).
